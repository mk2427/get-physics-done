# Internal Comparison: [Short Title]

If no selected protocol bundle materially informed the comparison, omit `protocol_bundle_ids` and `bundle_expectations` entirely.

## What Is Being Compared

| Quantity / Artifact | Source A | Source B | Shared Parameters | Metric | Threshold |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------ | --------- |
| [observable] | [artifact or path] | [artifact or path] | [regime / settings] | [metric] | [rule] |

## Convention And Normalization Check

- [ ] Observable definitions match
- [ ] Units / normalization match
- [ ] Threshold is tied to the right contract target or benchmark anchor
- [ ] No decisive target was replaced by a weaker proxy
- [ ] Any selected protocol bundle guidance is recorded only as additive provenance and does not override contract thresholds

## Results

| Subject | Metric Value | Verdict | Notes |
| ------- | ------------ | ------- | ----- |
| [claim-id] | [value] | [pass/tension/fail] | [why] |

## Follow-Up

- [Action to take if any verdict is not a clean pass]
```

When the comparison is decisive for a contract-backed claim or deliverable, `comparison_verdicts` is required. Use contract IDs only: if the compared object is a file or figure, attach the verdict to the owning deliverable or reference ID instead of inventing an `artifact` subject kind. Only `subject_role: decisive` closes a decisive requirement; `supporting` and `supplemental` verdicts remain informative context. If selected protocol bundles informed the comparison design, record them in `protocol_bundle_ids` / `bundle_expectations` as provenance only; they do not replace contract IDs, benchmark anchors, or pass/fail thresholds.

`comparison_verdicts` is a closed schema. Use only the documented keys above, do not invent extra fields, and keep every verdict row schema-tight before writing the ledger.
